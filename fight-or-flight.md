**You are a motley flock of birds.** You have banded together to outmatch the competition for the premium seed medley that **Jan the human** pours into her bird feeder every day. While you may not exactly be birds of a feather, you still must flock together to prepare for the harsh winter ahead.

## Dice: Use When Doing Something Risky

Roll **1d6** to see how well (or poorly) you do. <br>

The GM can grant you a single **bonus die** if you are particularly inventive, collaborative, or well-equipped.

#### For **FIGHT**, roll under your number.

#### For **FLIGHT**, roll over your number.

<ul>
<li> If ZERO dice succeed, it goes poorly. Work with the GM to figure out what goes wrong.</li>
<br>
<li> If ONE die succeeds, it happens at a cost. Work with the GM to figure out the complication.</li>
<br>
<li> If TWO OR MORE dice succeed, it goes really well!</li>
<br>
<li> If you roll your EXACT NUMBER, you are a lucky duck! You succeed and add a die to the BIRD BATH. Anyone can use the bonus die on a later roll.</li>
</ul>

## GM: Run the Game

### Roll for a threat and problem:

<!-- Threat Table -->

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Threat</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>A veritable army of squirrels</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>A former member of your flock</td>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Jan's next-door neighbor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Some unruly teens</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>A straight-up bear</td>
</table>

<!-- Problem Table -->

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4">Problem</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Emptied</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Sabotaged</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Destroyed</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Beguiled</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Stole</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Kidnapped</td>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><b>The Bird Feeder</b></td>
<td colspan="2"><b>Jan</b></td>
</table>

Start the game **after the inciting incident**. Before a threat does something to the characters, describe the situation and ask the players how they want to react.

>*The teens ride off on their bicycles with the bird feeder in town. What do you do?*

**Call for rolls** when outcomes are uncertain. Use failures to **drive the action. Change the situation** after every roll.

Guide the players to fill in details about the world.

>*Why did a member of your flock leave?*

### GM Goal: Play to find out how the flock defeats the threat.
